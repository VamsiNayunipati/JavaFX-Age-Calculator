Write a JavaFX program that will capture the selected birth date on the date picker and subtract the current date from it to calculate Jane’s age. Then the age is displayed on the application. For example, you select 11/2/2020 on the date picker and the current date is 11/3/2024, then your program should display “Jane’s age is 4 years.” You may show more granular result like “Jane’s age is 4 years and 1 day.” Or “Jane’s age is 4 years, 0 months, and 1 day.” Any of these three formats is fine.  

So, your application should have:

1.	A label towards the top of the screen that reads: “Pick Jane’s birth date” 
2.	In the center of the screen will be a date picker. 
3.	There will be another label towards the bottom of the screen which is only visible after the user selects a date on the date picker. And it will read “Jane’s age is XX years.” or one of the formats mentioned above. 
One of your main tasks will be to subtract a date from another.  This can have very granular outcome like 12 years 6 months 15 days 8 hours 34 minutes and 5 seconds. It may also show only the year. You can decide to show any output. There are several ways you can do it. Feel free to use any programming technique. I would suggest avoiding the ‘Date’ class. Most of its methods are deprecated.
